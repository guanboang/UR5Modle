#  UR5 Robotic Arm: Blender and FBX Files with Skeleton and IK

This document provides a description of the Blender and FBX files for the UR5 Robotic Arm that include skeleton rigging and inverse kinematics (IK) functionalities. A total of four Blender files have been uploaded.

## File Breakdown

### 1. UR5.blend

This file serves as the base file for setting up the skeleton. It contains the UR5 model, but the skeleton is not bound to any parts, and no IK is implemented.

### 2. UR5New.blend

In this file, the skeleton has been bound to the parts of the UR5 model. However, no inverse kinematics is applied.

### 3. UR5-2.blend

This is one of the two versions that include both skeleton binding and IK. UR5-2.blend has a specific binding sequence and adjustments to facilitate IK.

### 4. UR5-3.blend

Similar to UR5-2, this file also contains the skeleton bound to the UR5 parts, with inverse kinematics. However, it differs in the binding sequence and adjustments compared to UR5-2.

## Special Thanks

A special thanks to Nathan for providing guidance throughout the process. Additionally, thanks to Mauro for his URDF to OBJ conversion script which has been invaluable.

## Upcoming Tutorial

Please note that a detailed tutorial covering the processes involved will be written and uploaded here once everything is organized and finalized.

Keep an eye on this space for the tutorial update.
